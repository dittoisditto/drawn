			<p>Hi! My name is Helen, and I'm currently a sophomore in high school. I'm a self taught digital artist and aspiring game developer.</p>

			<h2>Interest in STEM</h2>
			<div class="double-information">
			<h3>JavaScript (Khan Academy)</h3>
		<p>From a young age, I had always been interested in coding, but I was always too intimidated by how coding appeared to even attempt to try it myself. It didn't help that no one in my family had jobs in the technological field. One day in 3rd grade while I was practicing math problems on Khan Academy, I stumbled upon a Computer Science section. Back then, Khan Academy's CompSci material was sparce, but it was fascinating to me as a 3rd grader. I started their Intro to JS program and tried to follow along with the videos they had. Admittingly, I didn't understand a lot of the code I was implementing in Khan Academy's editor, and I was really more interested in the interesting art you could create with code. While I ended up abandoning it for good in 5th grade, I think it was the first STEM experience I had that made me subconsciously want to learn more about technology, particularly about coding and programming.</p>

			<h3>HTML/CSS (Website Design)</h3>
			<p>In 7th grade, I joined a small group of unaffiliated students who all wanted to learn more about coding and programming. The first subject we discussed in that small group was website design. While I didn't really know much about the topic I was learning, I was fascinated by the fact that I could create websites with code that I had never even tried to decipher before. By the end of 7th grade, I had successfully learned a good amount of Website Design that I wanted to try to make a professional looking website. It wouldn't be until the beginning of sophomore year when I was able to obtain a few custom domains and make two websites all on my own: middlegradestem.tech and the current website you are on now. While I don't plan on pursuing website design any further, it was really the first step in my ongoing interest in STEM.</p>

		<h3>Python</h3>
		<p>After learning website design, I wanted to try to learn a programming language. I knew of Python and the fact that it was a popular programming language among industries (and particularly among high schools), so I decided to learn it as it seemed simpler than other programming languages. After doing some extensive research on python syntax, I had gotten the basic concepts of loops, functions, and statements. However, I didn't really know where I could use my new python knowledge. I participated in the College of Charleston's High School Programming Competition to see how my python ability fared against other long-time high school programmers. Even though my team only scored 9th place out of 40 teams, it taught me a lot about the mindset needed for programming and how competitive it can be for programmers. Afterward, I sort of abandoned python to focus more on my studies in school. It wouldn't be until my fascination with game design when I would be grateful for the python knowledge that I had accrued. </p>

	<h3>Game Design (Roblox)</h3>
	<p>I've always liked video games. As a child, I was a big fan of games like Animal Jam, Club Penguin, Monkey Quest, etc, etc. I enjoyed playing these web games, whether it was on library computers or one of the family laptops. In 2014, our family had gotten a new laptop that supported Windows 8. Windows 8 had an interesting feature where it recommended games on the home screen of the desktop. Of course, I browsed all of the games that were found there, and I found a game that seemed very interesting. It was a game called Roblox. After downloading it, I would spend hours just playing games and having fun. At the time, there were three things players could do: play games, build things, or use Roblox studio to create games. I was the most interested in the building portion of Roblox. It basically put the player in a sandbox sort of environment where the player could take premade models and build whatever they wanted: buildings, cities, stories, etc. When Roblox decided to cancel this building mode, I had to turn to the editing portion of Roblox to be able to build like I used to. It was actually a lot more fun than I had initially thought. With Roblox Studio, I had the ability to build and even code my own models from scratch. I would spend entire weeks just dedicated to building models and trying to improve the way I created them. Sadly, I had to stop playing Roblox for the sake of my studies, but it encouraged me to consider making games as a hobby later on.</p>
