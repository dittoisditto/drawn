			<h2>Interest in STEM</h2>
				<div class="event left">
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<div class = "paragraphs">
					<p>From a young age, I thought coding was the coolest thing ever. The idea that a person could do so much with a few characters was just so interesting, but I was too intimidated to even attempt it for myself. I also didn’t have anyone in my immediate family that specialized in technology or programming, so I had no mentors or role models that could help me. Below are some snippets of my journey from being clueless about code to actively trying to learn more about programming.</p>

					<h3>HTML/CSS (Website Design)</h3>
					<div class="paragraphs">
					<p>In middle school, I joined a small group of students that was created in order to teach more kids about STEM related topics. While we did discuss topics like android app creation, SQL, etc., the main subject we focused on was website design. After a lot of research, I successfully ended the first semester of 7th grade with a decent knowledge of website design. However, it wouldn't be until the beginning of sophomore year when I was able to publish two websites: middlegradestem.tech and the current website you are on now. Website design taught me a lot about the fundamentals of code management and helped me understand that coding isn’t as out-of-reach as I used to believe.

					<h3>Python</h3>
					<div class="paragraphs">
					<p>After learning website design, I wanted to try to learn a programming language. Admittingly, I didn’t really know where to start. I joined my high school’s programming club to try to learn more about programming, but many of its resources were for those who had had experience in programming. A few of my friends were learning Python at the time, so I decided to try my hand at it. However, I didn't really have a place to utilize Python: I had no real projects or plans to use the syntax that I had learned. As a result, I was forced to abandon it because I just didn’t have a real use for it. It wouldn't be until my fascination with game design when I would be grateful for the Python knowledge that I had accrued.

					<h3>Game Design</h3>
					<div class="paragraphs">
					<p>Because of the circumstances of COVID-19, many of my extracurriculars were cancelled. I ended up having a lot of time on my hands as a result. One of my hobbies is playing video games, which I spent a good amount of my time doing. I became curious about how these games were made and started doing my own research on game design. Before I knew it, I was following tutorials on game design and actively tracking the progress of up-coming games because it was just such an interesting topic. By the end of 2020, I finished a rudimentary platformer called “Liberating Infection”, which will hopefully be the first in a long list of games that I plan on making.
