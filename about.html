			<p>Hi! My name is Helen, and I'm currently a sophomore in high school. I'm a self taught digital artist and aspiring game developer.</p>
			<h2>Interest in STEM</h2>
				<div class="double-information">
					<h3>JavaScript (Khan Academy)</h3>
					<p>From a young age, I was always interested in the general appearance of coding, but I was too intimidated by it to even try to understand it. I also didn’t have anyone in my immediate family that specialized in technology or programming, so I had no mentors or role models with regards to the STEM field. In fact, my first encounter with coding would be purely on accident. One day, I was solving some math problems on Khan Academy when I accidentally clicked the wrong subject: I clicked the computer science aspect of Khan Academy instead of math. I was about to click off of the website until I noticed the courses that Khan Academy taught. Intrigued, I clicked the first lesson of Intro to JS and began following along with the online instructor. I would spend many weeks using this website to learn JavaScript and the fundamentals of programming like loops and functions. While I ended up abandoning the Khan Academy JavaScript course to focus more on academics, it was probably the first time I became interested in technology and STEM.

					<h3>Game Design (Roblox)</h3>
					<p>As a child, I was a big fan of games like Animal Jam, Club Penguin, Monkey Quest, etc. So in 2014 when I discovered a semi-popular game called Roblox, I immediately downloaded it and began playing. I spent the first year of my Roblox activity on just playing the different types of games other players had created and published on the website. One day, I was curious on how exactly these everyday people could create such beautiful models and environments. Therefore, I downloaded the other part of Roblox that I had never explored before: Roblox Studio. Roblox Studio is the game editor that players could use to experiment, edit, or even develop entire games with. I ended up spending the next two years of Roblox solely on Roblox Studio. I would create basic games like obbies, RPGs, and more. I had an especially fun time honing my 3D modelling skills, spending hours on perfecting a building or a scene. While Roblox has become a little antiquated for my liking, it was really the first push I had towards being more invested in 3D modelling and game design in general.

					<h3>HTML/CSS (Website Design)</h3>
					<p>In 6th grade, I joined a small group of students that was created in order to teach more kids about STEM related topics. While we did discuss topics like android app creation, SQL, etc., the main subject we focused on was website design. Even though I was a little underaged for the group, I tried as hard as I could to understand the subject. Through a lot of research and note taking, I successfully ended the first semester of 7th grade with a decent knowledge of website design. However, I didn’t really have any place where I could post the websites I created online, as I didn’t have the means to obtain custom domains. It wouldn't be until the beginning of sophomore year when I was able to obtain a few custom domains and make two websites all on my own: middlegradestem.tech and the current website you are on now. Website design taught me a lot about code management and how I could successfully combine two things I loved: art and STEM.

					<h3>Python</h3>
					<p>After learning website design, I wanted to try to learn a programming language. Admittingly, I didn’t really know where to start. I joined my high school’s programming club to try to learn more about programming, but it almost felt like the club was reserved for people who already knew what they were doing. A few of my friends at the time were learning python in their freshman year, so I decided to try my hand at it. After doing some extensive research on the python syntax, I finally relearned some of the programming fundamentals I had lost to time from Khan Academy’s JavaScript course. However, I didn't really know where I could use my newly acquired python knowledge. As a result, I was forced to abandon it because I just didn’t know what I could use it for. It wouldn't be until my fascination with game design when I would be grateful for the python knowledge that I had accrued.
