		<h1>Helen Wu</h1>

			<p>Hi! My name is Helen, and I'm currently a sophomore in high school. I'm a self taught digital artist and aspiring game developer.</p>
			<h2>Interest in STEM</h2>
				<div class="event left">
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<div class = "paragraphs">
					<p>From a young age, I was always interested in the general appearance of coding, but I was too intimidated by it to even try to understand it. I also didn’t have anyone in my immediate family that specialized in technology or programming, so I had no mentors or role models with regards to the STEM field.
					</p>

					<h3>HTML/CSS (Website Design)</h3>
					<div class="paragraphs">
					<p>In 6th grade, I joined a small group of students that was created in order to teach more kids about STEM related topics. While we did discuss topics like android app creation, SQL, etc., the main subject we focused on was website design. Even though I was a little underaged for the group, I tried as hard as I could to understand the subject. Through a lot of research and note taking, I successfully ended the first semester of 7th grade with a decent knowledge of website design. However, I didn’t really have any place where I could post the websites I created online, as I didn’t have the means to obtain custom domains. It wouldn't be until the beginning of sophomore year when I was able to obtain a few custom domains and make two websites all on my own: middlegradestem.tech and the current website you are on now. Website design taught me a lot about code management and how I could successfully combine two concepts I loved: art and STEM.

					<h3>Python</h3>
					<div class="paragraphs">
					<p>After learning website design, I wanted to try to learn a programming language. Admittingly, I didn’t really know where to start. A few of my friends at the time were learning Python in their freshman year, so I decided to try my hand at it. After doing some extensive research on the Python syntax, I successfully learned about programming fundamentals like loops, data types, functions, etc. However, I didn't really know where I could use my newly acquired Python knowledge. As a result, I was forced to abandon it because I just didn’t know what I could use it for. It wouldn't be until my fascination with game design when I would be grateful for the Python knowledge that I had accrued.
