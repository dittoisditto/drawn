		<h2>Middle Grade STEM</h2>
		<p class="general-paragraph">As someone that aspired to work in STEM, I always tried to find as many learning resources as possible. However, I've found that it can be very difficult to find people that teach about STEM related topics like Website Design and Python. Therefore, I decided that I wanted to help other people who have had to go through this same struggle when starting STEM. In the summer of 2020, I teamed up with other students to form Middle Grade STEM, a free volunteer tutoring program that gives middle school students teachers and resources to learn as much as they possibly can.</p>
